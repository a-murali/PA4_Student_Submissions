    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work with **BookReviews_1M** dataset to set up the word count exercise as you did in PA2. \n",
    "    - This is only to get you started on AWS and you won't need to report anything on this dataset except the run-time of your code.\n",
    "- Find the top 50 words containing the letter 'z' (lowercase) and their counts based on word count for the **BookReviews_4M** dataset\n",
    "- Calculate average and standard deviation of execution times over 3 runs for these three settings:\n",
    "    1. BookReviews_1M - 1 master + 1 worker node \n",
    "    2. BookReviews_4M - 1 master + 1 worker node\n",
    "    3. BookReviews_4M - 1 master + 3 worker nodes\n",
    "##### **NOTE** - The worker nodes are also called core nodes when initializing them on AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission on Gradescope:\n",
    "You need to submit the following three files under \"PA4\". Instructions to generate the csv files are given in their respective sections\n",
    "* The current notebook with outputs using **BookReviews_4M.json** dataset - **PA4_Starter.ipynb**\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Make sure that all expected outputs are present and the output of each cell matches the expected output. **Do not display your outputs under new cells**\n",
    "* csv file containing the 50 most frequently occurring words containing the letter 'z' and their counts for the **BookReviews_4M** dataset + column header - **50_words.csv** (Instructions given below)\n",
    "* csv file containing execution times for the below dataset and EMR cluster configuration - **exec_times.csv** (Instructions given below)\n",
    "    1. BookReviews_1M - 1 master + 1 worker node \n",
    "    2. BookReviews_4M - 1 master + 1 worker node\n",
    "    3. BookReviews_4M - 1 master + 3 worker nodes\n",
    "* Screenshot of terminated clusters, cluster creation time, cluster elapsed time, and your username.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### IMPORTANT submission guidelines enforced by autograder. Please read carefully:\n",
    "  * Make sure that all the cells in this notebook are executed before submission\n",
    "  * Some cells are marked **DO NOT DELETE**. These cells cannot be deleted and the output of these cells will be used for autograding\n",
    "  * You can add cells or delete(NOT recommended) other cells, but the **Expected Output** for each of the tasks MUST be the output of the cells marked as such\n",
    "  * DO NOT print anything other than the *exact* expected output. Do not include any sentences describing the output. This is strictly enforced by the autograder which checks for an *exact* match of the expected output. For example, if you are expected to print the PySpark version:\n",
    "      * '10.9.8' - <span style=\"color:#093\">CORRECT</span>\n",
    "      * 'The PySpark version is 10.9.8' - <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">INCORRECT</span>\n",
    "  * You can add cells for printing debugging information anywhere, but do not print anything else in **Expected Output** cells other than the expected output for the task\n",
    "  * For any task that expects `n` rows of a dataframe, **ALWAYS pass `truncate=False` as a parameter to `DataFrame.show` function**\n",
    "  * **NOTE - Any points deducted for not following submission guidelines will NOT be considered for regrade requests**\n",
