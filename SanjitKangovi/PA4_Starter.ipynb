    "- Work with **BookReviews_1M** dataset to set up the word count exercise as you did in PA2. \n",
    "    - This is only to get you started on AWS and you won't need to report anything on this dataset except the run-time of your code.\n",
    "- Find the top 50 words containing the letter 'z' (lowercase) and their counts based on word count for the **BookReviews_4M** dataset\n",
    "- Calculate average and standard deviation of execution times over 3 runs for these three settings:\n",
    "    1. BookReviews_1M - 1 master + 1 worker node \n",
    "    2. BookReviews_4M - 1 master + 1 worker node\n",
    "    3. BookReviews_4M - 1 master + 3 worker nodes\n",
    "##### **NOTE** - The worker nodes are also called core nodes when initializing them on AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission on Gradescope:\n",
    "You need to submit the following three files under \"PA4\". Instructions to generate the csv files are given in their respective sections\n",
    "* The current notebook with outputs using **BookReviews_4M.json** dataset - **PA4_Starter.ipynb**\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Make sure that all expected outputs are present and the output of each cell matches the expected output. **Do not display your outputs under new cells**\n",
    "* csv file containing the 50 most frequently occurring words containing the letter 'z' and their counts for the **BookReviews_4M** dataset + column header - **50_words.csv** (Instructions given below)\n",
    "* csv file containing execution times for the below dataset and EMR cluster configuration - **exec_times.csv** (Instructions given below)\n",

    "  * Make sure that all the cells in this notebook are executed before submission\n",
    "  * Some cells are marked **DO NOT DELETE**. These cells cannot be deleted and the output of these cells will be used for autograding\n",
    "  * You can add cells or delete(NOT recommended) other cells, but the **Expected Output** for each of the tasks MUST be the output of the cells marked as such\n",
    "  * DO NOT print anything other than the *exact* expected output. Do not include any sentences describing the output. This is strictly enforced by the autograder which checks for an *exact* match of the expected output. For example, if you are expected to print the PySpark version:\n",
    "      * '10.9.8' - <span style=\"color:#093\">CORRECT</span>\n",
    "      * 'The PySpark version is 10.9.8' - <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">INCORRECT</span>\n",
    "  * You can add cells for printing debugging information anywhere, but do not print anything else in **Expected Output** cells other than the expected output for the task\n",
    "  * For any task that expects `n` rows of a dataframe, **ALWAYS pass `truncate=False` as a parameter to `DataFrame.show` function**\n",
    "  * **NOTE - Any points deducted for not following submission guidelines will NOT be considered for regrade requests**\n",

In Seuss typical rhyming fashion we learn.\\n\\nThe illustrations are done by Quentin Blake so are not typical of Dr. Seuss.  They are interesting, colorful and fun.  The story is simple and repetitious making it easy for young readers to learn how to read new words.  Alongside the every day words, there are a few new things children might not know such as stilts and buttercups.  This is a fun early reader that makes learning to read easy due to repetition and rhyming.  It is written on the end of first grade reading level.  Recommended for grades k-2.|\n",
